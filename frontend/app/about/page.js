        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello, I'm Jacob Elbaz, a software and full-stack engineer.</p>
        <p>I created this website because of my passion for the Pokémon universe. As an avid fan, I wanted to contribute something meaningful to the community.</p>
        <p>Here we are, with a platform where Pokémon enthusiasts from around the world can come together and determine the most beloved Pokémon.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this website isn't to analyze Pokémon stats or competitiveness in battles, as you might find on other platforms. Instead, it's a celebration of personal preference. Whether you're drawn to a Pokémon's beauty, kindness, or power, this is a place to vote with your heart.</p>
        <p>Thank you for participating in the voting process! And if you're curious about my favorite Pokémon, take a peek at the background of the homepage!</p>
